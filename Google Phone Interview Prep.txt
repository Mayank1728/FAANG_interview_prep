Hi Raymond,
I hope all is well! It was wonderful to talk to you about your experience, opportunities at Google, and where you see your career headed.

Next Steps

To get you set up for your interview, please reply with the following - (1) your interview availability (please send 5-10 days with a time frame) . Once you've replied, I can submit your interview availability. After that, you will receive an email from one of my colleagues setting up the day and time of this call.

As we discussed, the first step is a 45-minute phone interview with an engineer who will present coding problems to you via a shared Google doc. The interviewer will be evaluating your:

- Coding ability in JavaScript
- Problem solving & communication skills
- Your knowledge of data structures & algorithms

Interview Preparation

Here are a few helpful resources that engineers have shared with us:
